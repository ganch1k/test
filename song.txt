Roses, I walked in the corner with the body screaming dolo
Never sold a bag but look like Pablo in a photo
This gon' make 'em feel the way like Tony killed Manolo
You already know though, you already know though
I walk in the corner with the money, on my finger
She might get it popping, I might wife her for the winter
I already know, already know, nigga roses
All I need is roses
